<h1>📄 Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>App Name:</strong> Billie Eilish Fan Moments</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 26, 2026</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Account Information</strong><br>
This app does not allow users to create accounts.
We do not collect email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, or any login credentials.
</p>

<p><strong>Nickname</strong><br>
The app assigns a default nickname ("Fans").
Users may change this nickname at any time.
This nickname is stored only locally on the user’s device and is never transmitted to the developer,
servers, Firebase, or any third party.
</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
We do not directly collect personally identifiable information (PII).
</p>

<h2>2. Device or Other Identifiers</h2>
<p>
The app uses third-party services (such as advertising SDKs) that may automatically collect
device or other identifiers (for example, Advertising ID).
</p>
<p>
This data is collected and processed by third-party providers for purposes such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advertising</li>
    <li>Analytics</li>
    <li>Fraud prevention</li>
</ul>
<p>
The developer does not directly store, access, or control these identifiers.
</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>
Information is used solely to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Display app content correctly</li>
    <li>Show advertisements</li>
    <li>Improve app performance and stability</li>
</ul>

<p>
No data is used for user profiling by the developer.
</p>

<h2>4. Advertisements</h2>
<p>
This app displays third-party advertisements, including banner and interstitial ads.
</p>
<p>
Advertising partners (such as Google AdMob) may collect and process data according to
their own privacy policies.
</p>
<p>
Users can limit or reset advertising personalization through their device settings.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
The developer does not sell, rent, or share personal data.
</p>
<p>
Non-personal data may be processed by third-party services strictly for
advertising and analytics purposes.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
<p>
The app does not store user data on external servers.
</p>
<p>
Because the app:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does not support user accounts</li>
    <li>Does not store personal data on developer-controlled servers</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is no manual data deletion request feature.
</p>
<p>
All locally stored data (such as the nickname) can be deleted at any time by uninstalling the app.
</p>
<p>
Data collected by third-party services is handled according to their respective privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
This app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
Any changes will be posted on this page.
</p>

<h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
